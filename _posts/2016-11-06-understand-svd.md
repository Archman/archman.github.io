Singular value decomposition, or SVD is really useful when you wanna figure
out a genral matrix's (square or rectangle) inverse. The main approach is
to decomposite a matrix to be multiplication of several matrices, 
i.e. ``A = S*V*D``, which is for SVD. You'll feel the beauty of math when
understanding it just a little bit, and it is interesting.
